    "title": "Asia's Web3 Playbook: Q1 2025 in Review",
    "author": "",
    "date": "",
    "content": "Asia isn’t chasing the crypto cycle. It’s laying the foundations for the next chapter of digital finance — one that’s institution-friendly, policy-aligned, and increasingly interoperable across borders. This report offers a country-level analysis of major Q1 2025 updates, with insights for businesses and builders navigating Asia’s evolving Web3 landscape.\n\nJapan’s Web3 strategy reflects a pattern of quiet precision—gradual but deliberate progress led by financial institutions. Recently, the government has taken a more active role by opening markets and advancing regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Japan expanded its role to the international stage. The Asia Web3 Alliance submitted a proposal to the U.S. SEC’s Crypto Task Force, calling for deeper U.S.–Japan cooperation on token classification and cross-border regulatory standards.\n\nIn Q1 2025, Japan took steps to improve the regulatory environment for its Web3 sector. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party proposed a revision to the crypto tax regime, including a flat 20% capital gains tax to replace the current progressive rate, which can reach up to 55%. The proposal also introduces a deferral of taxation on crypto-to-crypto transactions—such as exchanging Bitcoin for Ethereum—until the assets are converted to fiat currency.\n\nThe initiative aims to reduce tax complexity and establish a clearer framework for both investors and businesses. Although the 20% rate represents a step forward, it remains less competitive than jurisdictions such as South Korea, where capital gains on crypto assets are currently exempt. However, Japan’s focus on legal certainty may attract companies that prioritize regulatory predictability over lower tax burdens.\n\nOn the regulatory side, the Financial Services Agency(FSA) announced plans to reclassify crypto as a financial instrument by 2026. That might sound technical, but it’s a meaningful shift: it brings crypto into the same legal framework as traditional securities, with rules around insider trading and investor protections.\n\nThis signals Japan’s intent to position digital assets within the formal financial system, rather than treating them as speculative assets outside regulatory norms. For institutional participants, this shift introduces clearer legal standards and enhanced credibility. However, for smaller teams and DeFi developers, increased oversight may introduce operational constraints. The challenge lies in aligning with evolving regulatory expectations while innovation in the sector continues to outpace policy development.\n\nJapan also made progress on the stablecoin front. In a key infrastructure move, Circle partnered with SBI Holdings to bring USDC to Japan — making it the first foreign-issued stablecoin to operate under the country’s 2023 stablecoin law. SBI’s exchange also became the first licensed Electronic Payment Instruments Exchange Service Provider supporting foreign stablecoins.\n\nFurther momentum came through a memorandum of understanding signed between SMBC, Ava Labs, and several Japanese partners to explore the issuance of both yen- and dollar-denominated stablecoins.\n\nThis development reflects growing momentum in the stablecoin sector, where traditional financial institutions are starting to play a bigger role. In parallel, domestic projects like Progmat are gaining traction, suggesting Japan is becoming a competitive — albeit heavily regulated — environment for stablecoin innovation.\n\nSouth Korea made some quiet but important moves on the regulatory front in Q1 2025. One of the most anticipated was a loosening of the corporate crypto trading ban. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced that certain approved entities — like law enforcement agencies, universities, and nonprofits — can now sell their crypto holdings to convert them into cash. However, these institutions still face restrictions—they are allowed to sell digital assets but cannot purchase them. This isn’t a full reopening — it’s more like a narrow off-ramp for institutions holding crypto from earlier programs or donations.\n\nAt the same time, the country took a big step forward in its CBDC strategy. In March, the Bank of Korea launched a pilot involving 100,000 consumers and seven major banks. The pilot aims to simulate real-world payment scenarios and assess the infrastructure required for potential national deployment. As part of the program, retailers such as 7-Eleven South Korea will accept CBDC payments.\n\nWhile some doors are starting to open, others remain tightly shut. In March, Korean regulators ordered Google to remove 17 unlicensed crypto exchange apps — including Poloniex, KuCoin, and MEXC — from the Play Store. The move reinforced the FSC’s firm stance against unauthorized platforms operating without local registration.\n\nIn February, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) unveiled the \"A-S-P-I-Re\" roadmap, a strategic framework aimed at enhancing Hong Kong’s virtual asset market. This roadmap focuses on five key pillars: Access, Safeguards, Products, Infrastructure, and Relationships. Its 12 initiatives include plans to establish licensing regimes for over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks and custody service providers, as well as consultations on permitting crypto derivatives trading and margin lending within a regulated environment.\n\nThis approach follows the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules,” aiming to integrate traditional financial safeguards into the virtual asset sector while accounting for its unique characteristics. It reflects Hong Kong’s long-standing financial legacy and may position the city as one of the first jurisdictions to support experimental financial products within a regulated framework.\n\nBuilding upon the retail exchange licensing framework introduced in 2023, the SFC has approved a total of ten virtual asset trading platform licenses by the end of Q1 2025. For example, Bullish HK Markets Limited secured licenses in February 2025, enabling it to operate as a virtual asset trading platform under Hong Kong's regulatory framework.\n\nAlso in February, Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong, Animoca Brands, and Hong Kong Telecommunications (HKT) announced a joint venture to issue a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin, pending regulatory approval. The move brings together one of the world’s biggest banks with one of Web3’s most prominent venture players — a rare but powerful signal of institutional alignment around digital assets.\n\nHex Trust received a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), allowing it to offer cross-border crypto transfer services. Around the same time, Cumberland SG, the Asia division of U.S.-based trading firm Cumberland, secured in-principle approval for its MPI license, adding to the list of institutional players that are deepening their presence in Singapore.\n\nThese licensing moves aren’t about volume — they’re about signaling. MAS isn’t courting the names or chasing hype; it’s rewarding firms with clean corporate structures, global reputations, and tight compliance frameworks. While other markets focus on retail momentum or looser innovation zones, Singapore is carving out a role as the region’s policy anchor.\n\nIn a notable international development, Singapore and Vietnam signed a Letter of Intent to cooperate on digital asset regulation and oversight. The agreement, led by MAS and Vietnam’s State Securities Commission, aims to foster collaboration on regulatory frameworks, supervision, and industry standards — reinforcing Singapore’s role as a regional leader in crypto policy diplomacy.\n\nThis isn’t just goodwill diplomacy — it’s Singapore actively exporting its regulatory model. By partnering with fast-moving neighbors like Vietnam, MAS is helping to shape a regional ecosystem where regulatory alignment starts with Singapore.\n\nSingapore’s clarity and credibility continue to attract global players. In Q1, U.S. fintech platform Robinhood announced plans to roll out crypto services in Singapore by late 2025. Backed by its recent acquisition of Bitstamp, the move highlights Singapore’s appeal to global firms seeking to launch in Asia under a clear and structured regulatory environment.\n\nRobinhood’s entry isn’t just another license win, it reflects a bigger trend. More global fintechs are now choosing Singapore as their regional base, using its clear rules and strong oversight as a foundation for long-term growth. With assets like Bitstamp in hand, they’re doubling down on compliance-first expansion.\n\nVietnam took concrete steps in Q1 2025 toward formalizing a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets. In March, Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính’s Directive No. 27/NQ-CP mandated the development of crypto-specific regulations by mid-year, with provisions expected to cover asset classification, licensing requirements, AML/KYC compliance, and consumer protection mechanisms.\n\nConcurrently, the government is advancing plans to establish a dedicated financial hub—likely in Ho Chi Minh City—which will include a regulatory sandbox for fintech and cryptocurrency innovation. A pilot program for licensed centralized exchanges is already underway, with a targeted launch in 2026.\n\nOn March 27, the Vietnam Blockchain Association (VBA) hosted a high-level conference focused on centralized exchange oversight—marking a significant milestone in the country’s regulatory development. The event brought together representatives from key government agencies, over 30 financial institutions, and global exchange operators including Binance, OKX, and Bybit.\n\nDiscussions covered core regulatory issues such as taxation, cybersecurity, stablecoin governance, and FATF compliance. The breadth and depth of topics highlighted an emerging alignment between policymakers and industry stakeholders.\n\nThe government’s engagement reflects a shift from passive rulemaking to active collaboration in shaping market infrastructure. This approach underscores Vietnam’s intent to formalize the role of digital assets within its financial system, with transparency and regulatory clarity as central goals. Although launching a domestic exchange remains complex amid global competition, the ongoing dialogue lays the groundwork for a more structured and competitive digital asset market.\n\nThe conference also marked a notable partnership between the VBA and Dragon Capital, a leading asset manager with approximately $6 billion in assets under management. The collaboration focuses on research related to tokenized ETFs. With Thailand advancing regulatory approval for crypto ETFs, the emergence of a regulated product in Vietnam appears increasingly plausible.\n\nDespite this progress, Vietnam’s regulatory environment remains incomplete. A comprehensive framework for licensed and compliant operations is still pending, and is unlikely to be finalized until the upcoming crypto law and regulatory sandbox are implemented. As a result, Vietnam may not yet be suited for launching fully regulated operations.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC for trading on licensed digital asset exchanges, effective March 16. The decision followed a public consultation in February, during which most respondents supported the proposal.\n\nThe approval of USDT and USDC—two of the world’s largest stablecoins—represents a significant step in Thailand’s broader strategy to advance its digital asset ecosystem. The process also reflected a notable level of regulatory cooperation. Tether engaged directly with Thai authorities to meet compliance requirements and committed to improving its services for local users.\n\nTiger Research allows the fair use of its reports. ‘Fair use’ is a principle that broadly permits the use of specific content for public interest purposes, as long as it doesn't harm the commercial value of the material.

    "date": "",
    "content": "Standard Chartered Bank's recent analysis forecasts that US stablecoin market will expand from $230 billion to $2 trillion by 2028, largely driven by the impending GENIUS Act.\n\nThe GENIUS Act, supported by US legislators, prominently including Senator Bill Hagerty and Senator Cynthia Lummis, proposes robust guidelines for the stablecoin industry. Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire has already aligned USDC reserves with the Act’s anticipated norms.\n\nGeoffrey Kendrick of Standard Chartered remarks, “Expect a consolidated US dollar status in the short term, challenged possibly by other currency-backed stablecoins eventually.” This aligns with insights that Senate advances legislation impacting stablecoin debanking issues.\n\nDid you know? In a historical precedent, the EU MiCA regulation influenced similar stablecoin laws, shaping GENIUS to protect and integrate digital assets in financial systems, akin to Europe’s framework.\n\nToday's USDC stands at $1.00, exhibiting minor fluctuations in the recent quarter as observed in today’s CoinMarketCap listing. With a $60.39 billion cap and trailing 24-hour volume of $9.67 billion, USDC remains a strong market contender, reflecting minimal negative variance.\n\nAnalysis by Coincu indicates the GENIUS Act will consolidate US dollar dominance, although future expansion of non-USD stablecoins might prompt market shifts. Circle’s model for reserves, focusing on short-term Treasuries, sets an industry trend.",

The report also noted that foreign tourism has been a blow for the U.S. recently after the pandemic-era restrictions sparked a resurgence of international travel.\n\nAccording to ITA data, foreign travelers spent approximately $254 billion in the U.S. in 2024. The analytics firm also estimated in early March that the country would receive 77 million visitors in 2025.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysis revealed that roughly $20 billion in retail spending from international tourists in the U.S. may be compromised. A monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer prices published on April 10 indicated that early signs of a sharp pullback are already showing up as airfares, hotel rates, and car rental costs fell in March.\n\nPatrick Keyes, sales and marketing manager at Rainbow Air Helicopter Tours in Niagara Falls, said that the timing is “very interesting” for the firm, which just invested $25 million in a new building, an enhanced fleet, and a virtual reality attraction ahead of the busy summer season. Keyes also added that “we are waiting to see the fallout.”\n\nA report by OAG Aviation Worldwide also reported that Canadian flight reservations to the U.S. have plummeted by 70% through September versus the same period last year. U.S. summer bookings have also dropped by 25% among European tourists at Accor SA hotels. The firm’s Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Bazin maintained the drop could be attributed to border detentions creating a “bad buzz” and diverting tourists to other destinations.\n\nThe company’s senior executive maintained that his team was also contemplating whether the commission will need to tweak its strategy more toward domestic visitors as the situation unfolds. He added, “Oregon is not and will not take its eye off those international markets.”\n\nCryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.
