This consolidation phase, marked by mixed volume and alternating green/red candles, signals uncertainty, but also opportunity for active traders. Meanwhile DARK has officially launched on BingX, now available on both Spot and Perpetual Futures markets. This comes at a pivotal time in the crypto market. Adding to the mix, #China is reportedly offloading 194,000 #BTC (worth $16B+), which could inject short-term volatility into the broader crypto market. With DARK just entering price discovery and #BITCOIN in a crucial holding pattern, this could be a prime moment to catch early market momentum. Plus, BingX is offering up to 6,000+ USDT in rewards for new users. Watch closely, Trade wisely as Volatility can be equal to opportunity.\n\n#Mantra #BTC Price Analysis#",

      "text": "üß© Building Crypto Liquidity: Best Market Making Programs in 2025\n\n\n\n\nThe primary role of market makers in crypto is to enhance liquidity - a key factor in stabilizing prices and narrowing the bid-ask spread for assets like $BTC. Let‚Äôs explore why liquidity matters and highlight top market-making programs across leading exchanges.\n\n\n\n\nü§î What is needed to form proper liquidity in the market?\n\nFor a market to function properly, it needs a balanced mix of participants - like a LEGO structure:\n\nüìç Market makers are the \"large blocks\" - provide the foundation and stability.\n\nüìç Retail traders are the \"small pieces\" - drive organic flow and activity.\n\nA complete structure is only possible when both are working together.\n\n\n\n\nWhere to find this \"quality liquidity\"?üöÄ\n\nBased on this balanced LEGO structure, I‚Äôve identified some of the best MM programs that, in my view, offer the best conditions for liquidity providers:\n\nüìç WhiteBIT –æffers special conditions for market makers, algorithmic traders and arbitrageurs. Fees can go as low as - 0.012% for makers and 0.020% for takers in Spot, and - 0.012% for makers and 0.025% for takers in Futures.\n\nüìç Bybit offers rebates up to - 0.005% for both Spot and Derivatives trading. Market makers also enjoy exclusive fee discounts and access to institutional loans.\n\n\n\n\nüåç Hank Huang, CEO of Kronos Research, shared his perspective how MM programs actually ensure liquidity:\n\n\"Imagine the market as a LEGO city. Market makers and institutions are the large foundation blocks constructing the bridges, skyscrapers, and core infrastructure that give the city its strength and stability. Retail traders are the smaller bricks, the minifigures, and decorative elements adding color, character, and constant motion. Without market makers, the entire structure risks collapse. Without retail, the city loses its soul becoming a lifeless, empty shell. It‚Äôs the harmony of all pieces big and small that brings the city to life and keeps it thriving.\"\n\n\n\n\n#BTC Price Analysis# #BTC",

You‚Äôre falling behind because they rigged the system to make you poorer. At the same time, they get richer, louder, and more untouchable.\n\n\n\n\nThis isn‚Äôt policy. It‚Äôs plunder. And inflation is their weapon of choice.\n\n\n\n\nAnd here‚Äôs what they don‚Äôt tell you:\n\n\n\n\nInflation never resets. It compounds. Prices don‚Äôt drop back down. Your rent doesn‚Äôt rewind. The damage sticks, and it stacks, year after year.\n\n\n\n\nSo even if inflation ‚Äúslows,‚Äù you‚Äôre still stuck paying more forever for what used to cost less.\n\n\n\n\nWake up. They‚Äôre not saving you. They‚Äôre strip-mining your future to fund their delusions.\n\n$BT\n\n\n\n\n#BTC #Macro Insights# #BTC Price Analysis# #Metaplanet#",

      "text": "The problem with the world today is that intelligent people are often filled with doubts, not because they are wrong, but because they understand the complexities of various issues.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, those who lack understanding are often overly confident, and their certainty is frequently mistaken for wisdom.\n\n\n\n\nSocial media amplifies this problem, rewarding boldness over thoughtfulness, which makes false confidence appear as truth on a massive scale.\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, we find ourselves in a cycle where individuals with limited knowledge overestimate their competence, while their messages are amplified.\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, true experts, who are aware of the complexities involved, allow for error and flexibility. This trait contributes to their expertise but often leads to their messages being diminished in comparison.\n\n$BTC\n\n\n\n\n$BTC #Macro Insights# #BTC Price Analysis# #Metaplanet#",
